Defines the classes needed to implement the event queue using a priority 
queue that does not support searching. If used unwisely, the performance
of the LineSweep algorithm would again fail to achieve its O((n+k) log n)
as average case performance.
<p>
The problem with SlowEventQueue is that LineSweep requires no duplicate
reporting of intersections. For this to work, you must be careful not to
insert the same point multiple times into the event queue. This could 
happen if there are numerous pairs of lines that intersect at the same
intersection point (an easy case to construct). Thus the insert method 
actually behaves more like merge.
