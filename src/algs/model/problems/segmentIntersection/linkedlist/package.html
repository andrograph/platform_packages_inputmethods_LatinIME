Defines the classes needed to implement the LineSweep algorithm using 
double-linked lists to store the LineState.
<p>
Following such an approach prevents LineSweep from achieve its O((n+k) log n)
behavior because of the costs in updating the line state. One will not see
the performance degradation until the size of the line state exceeds a lower
threshold. This example is provided as a warning. Make sure that when choosing
to implement an algorithm that you choose the proper data structures that will
achieve that goal. No detail can be overlooked. In this case, the costs of
maintaining the line state will force LineSweep (using these linked lists) to
be O(n^2) at times.
