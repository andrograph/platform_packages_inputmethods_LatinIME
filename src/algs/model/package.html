Defines a set of interfaces for core entities used by various algorithms. Contains
the FloatingPoint class which is used to normalize numerous floating point 
computations to deal with round-off error that occurs.

Throughout the code in this repository, we have endeavored to write each algorithm
in an independent way from the arbitrary means by which the input is structured.
While this is easy to do when arrays are the standard means of input, it becomes
challenging when working with Computational Geometry. Thus, in this package you
will find interfaces for the most common elements in 2- and n-dimensions. All 
of the interfaces to the Computational Geometry algorithms are designed to 
work with these interfaces. Such an approach should make it easy for you to 
adapt the existing algorithms to your own needs.
